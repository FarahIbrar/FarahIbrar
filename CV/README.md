# Farah Ibrar - Data Scientist

Welcome, and thank you for visiting.

Iâ€™m Farah Ibrar, a data science professional with a strong foundation in predictive modelling, statistical analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and advanced machine learning techniques.  I also enjoy building meaningful dashboards and data visualisations that communicate insights clearly and effectively using Tableau and Python.

My approach is grounded in extracting actionable insights from complex datasets, with a strong focus on commercial application and customer behaviour. I am particularly interested in data-driven storytelling that supports strategic decision-making, such as customer segmentation, propensity modelling, and campaign evaluation.

With an academic background in Biomedical Sciences and Immunology, I bring a unique interdisciplinary perspective to data science. My transition from research to analytics has equipped me with robust problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and a passion for deriving insight from evidence.

If you would like to connect, collaborate on a project, have a challenge in mind, or simply discuss ideas in the data space, feel free to get in touch. I am always open to new opportunities and meaningful conversations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
